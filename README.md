# Toy project

## Description
Create some fun control code that can be used to drive a common robot, e.g. Turtlebot3 (specifically the burger), to an exact location from anywhere on a given map.

## **Important** Please note
The folder */tb3_esentials* has been included to override (if it exists) the binary packages for the turtlebot3. 
This has been included just in case any tweaks are made to the navigation stack, e.g., local cost map inflation radius, etc.
